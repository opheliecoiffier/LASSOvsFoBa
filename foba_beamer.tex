\subsection*{Introduction}
\label{sub:Intro}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
To measure the quality of prediction, we use linear prediction model :
\[f(x)=\trans{\beta}x\]
With \[\hat{\beta}=\underset{\beta \in \bbR^d}\argmin\sum_{i=1}^n \Phi(\trans{\beta}x_i, y_i)+\lambda g(\beta)\]

\label{sub:Lasso}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The Lasso method}
\vspace{0.4cm}
Method uses $L_1$ regularization.\\
We have \[\hat{\beta}=\underset{\beta \in \bbR^d}\argmin\sum_{i=1}^n \Phi(\trans{\beta}x_i, y_i)+\lambda ||\beta||_1\]

\begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\vspace{0.5cm}
We find these results :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test points :} FoBa for \textit{Ionosphere} data $\&$ FoBa/OMP for \textit{Boston Housing} data
    \item \textbf{Training points :} OMP (depending on sparcity for \textit{Ionosphere} data
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}
The article finds :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test points :} FoBa for small sparsity and for \textit{Boston housing} data $\&$ Lasso for \textit{Ionosphere} data
    \item \textbf{Training points :} the mixed algorithm (FoBa)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}
Finally, we must choose the best algorithm and the best method depending on data, sparsity and mathematics conditions that we can check.
